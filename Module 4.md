	- signal conditioner1 -tranducer output to compatible signal from transmitter
	- transmitter - modulation amplification multiplexing signal conversion for transmission
	- receiver - demodulation amplification reverse signal conversion de multiplexing
	- signal conditioner2 - processes receiver output as needed to drive end device
	- WIRED Telemetry
		- uses pair of copper wires to transmit
		- transmitter has AF/Pulse modulator and amp
	- Digital wired
		- uses A/D converter to process an transmit of telephone lines via modem
	- WIRELESS TELEMETRY
		- transmitter contains RF modulator and amp 
		- connected to antenna
	- Typical Telemetry
