- [ ] M2M vs IOT
	- Machine 2 machine
		- provide direct communication between individual machines or devices
		- it uses networking of machines for the purpose of remote monitoring, control and data exchange

		```
		- comprises of machines which has embedded hardware modules for sensing actuation and communication
		- uses ZigBee, Bluetooth, Power LINE Communication
		- can be wired or wireless
		- Area network uses proprietary or Non IP based protocols
		- Rest uses IP based protocol
		- M2M Gateway
			- intermediary between various devices and systems in M2M system
			- connectivity between machines
			- data exchange between machines
			- compatibilities between different networks
			- remote M2M area to core network
		- Uses premises storage
		- Uses homogenous machine types within area network
		- point solutions
		- Network and link Layer for Communication
	- IOT
		- it is broader concept for internet communication between devices. It involves  a wide range of devices, sensors , actuator and applications that communicate via internet
		- IOT uses IP BASED PROTOCOLS
		- IOT is more software driven
		- IOT uses Cloud to store data
		- unique identifiers for devices
		- IOT is connected to cloud for remote solutions
		- Primarily Application and Transport layer for Communication

- [ ] SDN
	- simplifies data communication in networks
	- router has control and data forwarding plane
	- sdn removes control responsibilities from router
	- has a unified view of network makes configuration, management and provisioning simpler
	- application layer --> SDN_controller -->Infrastructure Layer (routers) Openflow protocol
	- +
		- easier management of network
		- programmable network
		- agility
		- centralised management
		- improved visibility of network
		- cost effective network
		- improved securtiy
