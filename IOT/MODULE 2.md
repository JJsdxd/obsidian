- [ ] M2M vs IOT
	- Machine 2 machine
		- provide direct communication between individual machines or devices
		- it uses networking of machines for the purpose of remote monitoring, control and data exchange

		M2M_Area_Networks --> M2M_gateway -->M2M_CoreNetwork_wired/wireless-->M2M_Applications
		```
		- comprises of machines which has embedded hardware modules for sensing actuation and communication
		- uses ZigBee, Bluetooth, Power LINE Communication
		- can be wired or wireless
		- Area network uses proprietary or Non IP based protocols
		- Rest uses IP based protocol
		- M2M Gateway
			- intermediary between various devices and systems in M2M system
			- connectivity between machines
			- data exchange between machines
			- compatibilities between different networks
			- remote M2M area to core network
		- Uses premises storage
		- Uses homogenous machine types within area network
		- point solutions
		- Network and link Layer for Communication
	- IOT
		- it is broader concept for internet communication between devices. It involves  a wide range of devices, sensors , actuator and applications that communicate via internet
		- IOT uses IP BASED PROTOCOLS
		- IOT is more software driven
		- IOT uses Cloud to store data
		- unique identifiers for devices
		- IOT is connected to cloud for remote solutions
		- Primarily Application and Transport layer for Communication

- [ ] NFV
	- is the concept of replacing dedicated network devices such as routers and firewalls with software running on general purpose cpus or virtual machines
	- NFV provides infrastructure on which SDN can run
	- are mutually beneficial to each other but not dependant

- [ ] SDN
	- simplifies data communication in networks
	- router has control and data forwarding plane
	- sdn removes control responsibilities from router
	- has a unified view of network makes configuration, management and provisioning simpler
	- application layer --> SDN_controller -->Infrastructure Layer (routers) Openflow protocol
	- +
		- easier management of network
		- programmable network
		- agility
		- centralised management
		- improved visibility of network
		- cost effective network
		- improved securtiy

- [ ] Smart Objects
	- building blocks of IOT
	- They have
		- Processing UNIT
		- sensors and actuators
		- communication device
		- Power Source
		- Trends
			- size decreasing
			- power consumption decreasing
			- processing power is increasing
			- communication capabilities improving
			- communication is being standardized

- [ ] Sensor Networks 
	- 
- [ ] WSN
	- made up of wirelessly connected smart objects referred to as motes
	- is a network of spatially distributed sensors that can sense process and communicate data
	- limitations
		- Limited Processing Power
		- Limited memory
		- Lossy Communication
		- limited Transmission Speed
		- Limited Power
	- Usually deployed in very large numbers to overcome constraints of individual nodes
	- cost decreasing
	- heirarchy - aggregates similar sensor readings in  close proximity to each other
