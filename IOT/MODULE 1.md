- [ ] IOT
	- describes physical objects(things) with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data over the internet or other communication networks
- [ ] Characteristics of IOT
	1. Dynamic & Self Adapting
		1. IOT devices should have the ability to make dynamic changes based on available context from user/sensed environment
		2. eg :- surveillance cameras changing modes based on day and night by time/light sensing
		3. eg :- lower to higher resolution modes if any motion is detected to save on storage as well retaining correcting recordings of relevant times
	2. Self-Configuring
		1. The ability of an IOT device to setup to IOT infrastructure provided networking and fetch software upgrades with limited/zero user intervention
		2. This ability allows a large number of devices to work together to provide functionalities
	3. inter operable Communication Protocols
		1. support number of inter operable communication protocols to communicate with other devices as well as IOT infrastructure
	4. Unique identity/Uniquely Identifiable
		1. Each device should have its own unique identifier/unique identity (IP address)
		2. IOT interfaces allow users to
			1. query devices
			2. monitor their status
			3. remotely control
	5. Integrated into Information Network
		1. IOT devices are usually integrated into a information network which allows them to communicate with other devices and systems for exchanging data.
		2. This integration allows the IOT devices to become smarter using collective intelligence
		3. allows for larger data to be aggregated and analysed to predict weather etc..
		4. weather monitoring nodes communicating is an example
- [ ] IOT Enabling Technologies
- [ ] Physical Design of IOT
	- The Things in IOT usually refers to devices that are uniquely identifiable can perform remote sensing/actuating/monitoring capabilities
	- IOT device can
		- exchange data with other connected devices and applications
		- collect data from other devices and process the data locally
		- Send the data to centralized servers or cloud based application back-ends for processing the data
		- Perform some tasks locally and other tasks within the IOT Infrastructure based on temporal and space constraints
	- IOT device can contain several interfaces
		- I/O for sensors
		- Interfaces for Internet Connectivity
		- Memory and Storage Interfaces
		- Audio/Video Interfaces
	- Connectivity 
		- USB HOST
		- RJ45/INTERNET
