- [ ] IOT
	- describes physical objects(things) with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data over the internet or other communication networks
- [ ] Characteristics of IOT
	1. Dynamic & Self Adapting
		1. IOT devices should have the ability to make dynamic changes based on available context from user/sensed environment
		2. eg :- surveillance cameras changing modes based on day and night by time/light sensing
		3. eg :- lower to higher resolution modes if any motion is detected to save on storage as well retaining correcting recordings of relevant times
	2. Self-Configuring
		1. The ability of an IOT device to setup to IOT infrastructure provided networking and fetch software upgrades with limited/zero user intervention
		2. This ability allows a large number of devices to work together to provide functionalities
	3. inter operable Communication Protocols
		1. support number of inter operable communication protocols to communicate with other devices as well as
