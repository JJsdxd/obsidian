- [ ] PSOS 
	- portable Software on Silicon
	- Host- target type RTOs
	- 32 priority levels
	- footprint is only 12KB
	- supports priority inheritence priority ceiling and segmented memory management
	- doesn't support virtual memory
	- memory is physically continuous 
	- device drivers are outside kernel
	- Interrupt directly triggers ISR
	- Base stations of cell phones
- [ ] VRTX
	- double kernel VRTXmc and VRTXsa
	- mission and life critical applications like avionics
	- VRTXsa
		- large and medium sized applications
		- supports virtual memory
		- supports priority inheritence
		- system calls complete in fixed intervals and can be pre empted
	- VRTXmc
		- Optimised for low power consumption
		- optimised for ROM and RAM sizes has small footprint
		- no support for virtual memory
		- computer based toys cell phones

- [ ] RT Linux
	- Self hosted OS that runs alongside linux system
	- Real Time Kernel sits between the hardware and linux system
	- Linux runs as a low priority back ground  task of RT linux
	- RT application runs in the kernel space
	- Two independent kernels Real Time Kernel and Linux Kernel
	- deterministic scheduling tasks are run as Real Time task
