- [ ] Implement UVM testbench for UART

### Week 10: Finalize UVM Testbench
- [ ] Scoreboard, coverage, corner-case tests
- [ ] Push to GitHub, document process

### Week 11: Embedded System ‚Äì Dashboard Start
- [ ] Root and clean Galaxy Core Prime
- [ ] Remove bloatware or flash minimal ROM
- [ ] Inspect USB daughterboard + port clearance
- [ ] Begin battery removal plan + charging bypass
- [ ] Begin BLE TPMS parser (in Python or Android)

### Week 12: Dashboard Finalization + Display
- [ ] Replace micro-USB with USB-C manually (or breakout board)
- [ ] Test stable boot with direct power (with/without battery)
- [ ] Connect GPS and BLE modules
- [ ] Build Kivy or Qt UI: Nav + TPMS + battery/temp display
- [ ] Blog: Building a Custom Motorcycle Dashboard on Android Hardware
