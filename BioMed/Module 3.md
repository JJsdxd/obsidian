	- 21 electrodes separation of 10%/20% of the distance between nasion and inion between each electrode
	- Fp 1/2 - frontal polar 10% from nasion vertically as well as horizontally
	- F 4/8 - 20% front Fp2 vertically and 10 and 30% respectively from central line Fz to the right
	- F 3/7 - 20% from Fp1 vertically and 10 and 30% respectively from Fz to the left
	- C Central
	- P parietal
	- T Temporal - halfway 
	- O Occipital - 10% from inion
	- ODD numbers left

	- Montages refer to pattern of electrodes on the head and channels they are connected to
		- reference electrodes are placed on non active region forehead/earlobe
		- 10/20system
		- 21 electrodes
		- 10 and 20% of the distance between nasion and inion seperation between the electrodes
	- Electrode Montage Selector
		-  large panel to allow user to select electrode pairs
		- each channel is input from one electrode minus input from another
	- Preamp
		- every channel has individual multistage, ac coupled,very sensitive amplifier with differential input and adjustable gain in a wide range
		- high gain low noise since signals are low amplitude
		- HIGH CMRR 
		- no drift
	- Sensitivity control
		- one adjusts sensitivity of recording pen
