- [ ] bioelectric potential 
is the ionic voltages that are created due to the electrochemical activities in particular cells namely muscle and nerve cells
transducers are used to convert this into electric signals for monitoring biological parameters
The semi permeable nature of an excitable cell membrane may cause imbalance in the concentration of particular ions inside and outside the cell this is what causes ionic voltage buildup
