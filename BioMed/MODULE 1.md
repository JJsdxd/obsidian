- [ ] bioelectric potential 
is the ionic voltages that are created due to the electrochemical activities in particular cells namely muscle and nerve cells
transducers are used to convert this into electric signals for monitoring biological parameters
The semi permeable nature of an excitable cell membrane may cause imbalance in the concentration of particular ions inside and outside the cell this is what causes ionic voltage buildup

- [ ] polarisation and depolarisation
cells have high concentration of K+ ions inside and Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions outside the cell membrane
ranges from -100mv to -60mv
**Polarized state**
	when a cell has come to rest aka no more ionic transfer is happening 
	resting potential is the membrane potential
	resting potential ranges from -60 to -100mv
**Depolarized State**
	when an ionic trigger occurs(external stimulus moving muscle pain etc) of potential above threshold of -55mV
	The Na$^+$ gated channels open up and allow flooding in of Na$^+$ ions 
	K$^+$ ions flow out too but at a much lower rate
	The net potential inside the cell becomes positive than the outer
	approximately 20mV
	This is considered depolarised state
**Repolarization**
	once the inrush of Na+ ions ends due to the voltage gradient created the voltage gated Na channels close and the membrane returns to original state
	then an active process called sodium pumping transports Na+ ions to the outside of the cell to regain original state of the cell
**Action Potential**
	The potential of a particular cell during which it is depolarizing and repolarizing
	The time period varies with type of cell
	all or nothing any stimulus below the threshold -55mV does not cause any depolarization/action and any stimulus above will trigger it

	stays at -70mV upon stimulus above -55mV Na+ and K+ gates open upon reaching depolarization Gates closes upon falling down the threshold of 0mV active Na+ and K+ pumps stops at -55mV threshold after repolarization slowly climbs and stabilizes at -70mv resting potential
	nerve and muscle cells take 1ms for action potential 
	heart cells takes upto 300ms
	refactory period time taken for the cell to stabilise and get ready for next stimulus 
		absolute:- no stimuli can act
		relative:- follows absolute but a higher amplitude stimuli can cause action
	when a cell is exited and generates an action potential it can act as stimuli for nearby cells and trigger a chain to excite neighbouring cells
	action potentials in a neuron are generated at one end and propagates to the axon on the other end
	no backflow due to refactory period
	rate of propagation through a fiber /cell to cell is called propagation rate
	in nerves propagation rate is also called conduction rate
	range from 20-140m/s
	in heart the rate is 0.2m/s to 0.4m/s
	
- [ ] Nernst equation
	It can be shown that a potential E exists between the inside and outside of a membrane based on the relative activity of the permeable ions in each of the solutions
	This relation is between ionic concentration(activity) and electrode potential
	**half cell potential** is the potential between the two solutions when there is no flow of ions across the membrane
$$
	N E =-(RT/nF)ln(C1F1/C2F2)
$$
	N E - Electric potential/ Nernst potential
	R- Universal Gas Constant 8.71J/K
	T - absolute temp
	n - valence of the electrode material
	F - Faraday Constant 96500C/(mol/valence)
	C1,C2 - concentration of ion1 on either side of the membrane
	F1,F2 - ""
