- [ ] bioelectric potential 
is the ionic voltages that are created due to the electrochemical activities in particular cells namely muscle and nerve cells
transducers are used to convert this into electric signals for monitoring biological parameters
The semi permeable nature of an excitable cell membrane may cause imbalance in the concentration of particular ions inside and outside the cell this is what causes ionic voltage buildup

- [ ] polarisation and depolarisation
cells have high concentration of K+ ions inside and Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions outside the cell membrane
ranges from -100mv to -60mv
**Polarized state**
	when a cell has come to rest aka no more ionic transfer is happening 
	resting potential is the membrane potential
	resting potential ranges from -60 to -100mv
**Depolarized State**
	when an ionic trigger occurs(external stimulus moving muscle pain etc) of potential above threshold of -55mV
	The Na$^+$ gated channels open up and allow flooding in of Na$^+$ ions 
	K$^+$ ions flow out too but at a much lower rate
	The net potential inside the cell becomes positive than the outer
	approximately 20mV
	This is considered depolarised state
**Repolarization**
	once the inrush of Na+ ions ends due to the voltage gradient created the voltage gated Na channels close and the membrane returns to original state
	then an active process called sodium pumping transports Na+ ions to the outside of the cell to regain original state of the cell
**Action Potential**
	The potential of a particular cell during which it is depolarizing and repolarizing
	The time period varies with type of cell
	all or nothing any stimulus below the threshold -55mV does not cause any depolarization/action and any stimulus above will trigger it

	stays at -70mV upon stimulus moves to
