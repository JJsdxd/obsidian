[[Wireless Communications]]

- [ ] Average Probability of Error in BPSK Rayleigh fading Ts~=Tc
- [ ] Multicarrier modulation schemes ISI
- Uses multiple parallel sub channels instead of a single channel for wireless high data rate communication
- transmitted bitstream is split up into many different substreams to be transmitted over subchannels 
- Under ideal conditions the channels are orthogonal in nature
- data rate in individual subchannel much less than total data rate
- subchannel bandwidth is also much lesser than total system bandwidth *number of subchannels chosen in order to create subchannels with bandwidth less than coherence bandwidth for relatively flat fading*
- the Inter Symbol Interference is reduced due to the closeness to coherence bandwidth
