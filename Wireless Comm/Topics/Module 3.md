- [ ] Average Probability of Error in BPSK Rayleigh fading Ts~=Tc
- [ ] Multicarrier modulation schemes ISI
- Uses multiple parallel sub channels instead of a single channel for wireless high data rate communication
- transmitted bitstream is split up into many different substreams to be transmitted over subchannels 
- Under ideal conditions the channels are orthogonal in nature
- data rate in individual subchannel much less than total data rate
- subchannel bandwidth is also much lesser than total system bandwidth *number of subchannels chosen in order to create subchannels with bandwidth less than coherence bandwidth for relatively flat fading*
- the Inter Symbol Interference is reduced due to the closeness to coherence bandwidth 
- the subchannels need not be **continuous**
- is efficiently implemented in digital communication in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing(OFDM) ISI can be completely eliminated with the use of **Cyclic prefix**
- the symbol time is much greater than delay spread  
- Tm=1/Bc delay spread = 1/Coherence Bandwidth
- B = N(1+$\beta$ +$\varepsilon$)/Tn  $\beta$ -roll off /guard band factor, $\varepsilon$ -channel fading **FOR NON-OVERLAPPING SUBCHANNELS**
- B= (N + $\beta$ + $\varepsilon$)/Tn **FOR OVERLAPPING SUBCHANNELS**

- **Subcarrier fading**  ;- each subchannel experiences flat fading which can at times cause HIGH BER in certain channels
- This needs to be compensated for by use of 
	- Coding with Interleaving over time and frequency
	- data bits are encoded into codewords then the resulting coded bits are interleaved across time and frequency 
	- this system uses the frequency diversity of a multi carrier system to correct for errors by using the received bits from high SNR subchannels to correct errors in subchannels with low SNR

	- **frequency Equalization** :- The received signal is multiplied by 1/$\alpha$ this removes impact of flat fading But also enhances the Noise power which does not address the performance degradation 
	- **Precoding** :- Here the inversion occurs in the transmitter instead of the receiver like in frequency equalization by $\alpha$ which is channel flat fading gain obtained via estimation.
		- requires infinite amount of power in Rayleigh fading channel
		- Noise power remains same as the division is done before transmission
	- **Adaptive Loading** :- the data rate and power assigned to each subchannel relative to subchannel gain. This requires knowledge of $\alpha$i in transmitter eg:- Variable rate Variable power MQAM
	- Cyclic Prefix :- for every sequence of length N the last $\mu$ samples are appended to the front of the sequence resulting in a sample length of N+$\mu$ 
		- out of which the $\mu$ samples eliminate ISI as well are not required to recover the encoded data 
		- There is an increase in required data rate per subchannel
	-**OFDM** :- OFDM converts a wideband channel into a set of narrowband orthogonal subchannels to using cyclic prefix to eliminate flat fading effect and noise via seperate QAM symbol for each subchannel.
		- The input stream is QAM modulated to give an output of X[0],X[1],..X[N-1] 
		- This symbol stream is passed through a serial to parallel converter
		- The output are discrete frequency components of OFDM modulator output s(t)
		- these frequency components are converted into time domain samples using inverse of DFT via an IFFT algorithm x[n] =x[0]+x[1]+...x[N-1]
		- A cyclic prefix  is added to this 
		- These are then ordered by a Parallel to Serial Converter then passed through a Digital to analog converter
		-  resulting in the baseband OFDM signal which is then upconverted to f$_0$ (+cos2$\pi$f$_0$t)
		- Receiver 
		- The received signal is downconverted from f$_0$ 
		- High frequency components are eliminated using the an LPF
		- Then it is converted from analog to digital 
		- The converted signal then has it's first $\mu$ samples removed and Serial to Parallel converted
		- The parallel components are then passed through an FFT 
		- Then the data is converted to parallel from Serial form and then passed through QAM demodulator to recover original data
