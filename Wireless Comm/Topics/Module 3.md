[[Wireless Communications]]

- [ ] Average Probability of Error in BPSK Rayleigh fading Ts~=Tc
- [ ] Multicarrier modulation schemes ISI
- Uses multiple parallel sub channels instead of a single channel for wireless high data rate communication
- transmitted bitstream is split up into many different substreams to be transmitted over subchannels 
- Under ideal conditions the channels are orthogonal in nature
- data rate in individual subchannel much less than total data rate
- subchannel bandwidth is also much lesser than total system bandwidth *number of subchannels chosen in order to create subchannels with bandwidth less than coherence bandwidth for relatively flat fading*
- the Inter Symbol Interference is reduced due to the closeness to coherence bandwidth 
- the subchannels need not be **continuous**
- is efficiently implemented in digital communication in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing(OFDM) ISI can be completely eliminated with the use of **Cyclic prefix**
- the symbol time is much greater than delay spread  
- Tm=1/Bc delay spread = 1/Coherence Bandwidth
- B = N(1+$\beta$ +$\varepsilon$)/Tn  $\beta$ -roll off /guard band factor, $\varepsilon$ -channel fading **FOR NON-OVERLAPPING SUBCHANNELS**
- B= (N + $\beta$ + $\varepsilon$)/Tn **FOR OVERLAPPING SUBCHANNELS**
- ---
- **Subcarrier fading**  ;- each subchannel experiences flat fading which can at times cause HIGH BER in certain channels
- This needs to be compensated for by use of 
	- Coding with Interleaving over time and frequency
	- data bits are encoded into codewords then the resulting coded bits are interleaved across time and frequency
